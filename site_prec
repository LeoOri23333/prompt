Because short‐duration precipitation events are primarily responsible for flooding in urbansystems, it is important to assess the response of extreme precipitation at hourly (or sub‐hourly)scales to a warming climate. This study aims to evaluate the projected changes in extreme rainfallevents across the region of Sicily (Italy) and, for two urban areas, to assess possible changes inDepth‐Duration‐Frequency (DDF) curves. We used Regional Climate Model outputs from Coordi-nated Regional Climate Downscaling Experiment for Europe area ensemble simulations at a~12 km spatial resolution, for the current period and 2 future horizons under the RepresentativeConcentration Pathways 8.5 scenario. Extreme events at the daily scale were first investigatedby comparing the quantiles estimated from rain gauge observations and Regional Climate Modeloutputs. Second, we implemented a temporal downscaling approach to estimate rainfall for sub‐daily durations from the modelled daily precipitation, and, lastly, we analysed future projectionsat daily and sub‐daily scales. A frequency distribution was fitted to annual maxima time seriesfor the sub‐daily durations to derive the DDF curves for 2 future time horizons and the 2 urbanareas. The overall results showed a raising of the growth curves for the future horizons, indicatingan increase in the intensity of extreme precipitation, especially for the shortest durations. TheDDF curves highlight a general increase of extreme quantiles for the 2 urban areas, thusunderlining the risk of failure of the existing urban drainage systems under more severe events.KEY WORDSclimate change, DDF, EURO‐CORDEX, extreme precipitation, RCM, temporal downscaling1 | INTRODUCTIONFloods arising from extreme rainfall events are one of the most costlyand dangerous natural hazards worldwide (Hallegatte, Green, Nicholls,& Corfee‐Morlot, 2013; Knapp et al., 2008). Understanding andquantifying potential changes to the magnitude of extreme rainfall isthus fundamental for the design of urban hydraulic systems and floodassessments. Specifically, observations of annual maximum rainfall(AMR) events are necessary to derive Depth‐Duration‐Frequency(DDF) curves, which, in turn, are used for the hydrological design offlood control infrastructure and water management systems. TheDDF curves, or intensity‐duration‐frequency curves, are usuallydeveloped by fitting a theoretical distribution to the AMR at differentsub‐daily and sub‐hourly durations. Therefore, understanding the pos-sible future changes in short‐duration rainfall might enablequantification of how DDF curves may consequently change and thepossible effects on urban hydrology.Evidence of positive trends in observed extreme rainfall has beendemonstrated by several studies for daily and sub‐daily timescales(Adamowski, Adamowski, & Bougadis, 2010; Alexander et al., 2006;Arnone, Pumo, Viola, Noto, & La Loggia, 2013; Bonaccorso & Aronica,2016; Brunetti, Buffoni, Maugeri, & Nanni, 2000; Burn, Mansour,Zhang, & Whitfield, 2011; Min, Zhang, Zwiers, & Hegerl, 2011; Villariniet al., 2011; Wang et al., 2014). The Mediterranean area has been dem-onstrated to be one of the regions most affected by changes in climate,indicated as one of the major “hot‐spots” in future climate projectionsReceived: 23 May 2017 Accepted: 6 December 2017DOI: 10.1002/hyp.11421332 Copyright © 2017 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. Hydrological Processes. 2018;32:332–348.wileyonlinelibrary.com/journal/hypespecially in the NW region. In the other two regions located in theeastern part of the island (SE and NE), the bias indicates that themodels underestimate the quantiles. After correction, the bias is clearlyreduced, with CS and NC subsequently characterized by smaller bias.Figure 5b provides the corresponding RMSE, before and after correc-tion; in this case, one can observe that NW and NE benefit most fromthe correction. The RMSE is significantly reduced especially for verylong return periods; for example, at 100 years, for the NW and NE, itvaries from ~1.5 (before correction) to less than 0.25 (after correction),denoting the effectiveness of the methodology. In all regions, theRMSE of the corrected series is less than 0.5, even for long returnperiods.FIGURE 4 Growth curves for daily rainfall obtained (a) before and (b) after bias correction for each of the six regions for the control period, that is,1973–2005. The black solid line denotes the growth curve obtained from the observed data. The analysed metropolitan areas that fall within theregions are also indicated.

The TFs previously identified werereapplied to the simulated precipitation for the two future horizons tocorrect the data, assuming that the TF correction factors are stationary.Hereinafter, we will analyse only the corrected RCM data by omittingthe “corrected” term for brevity.Figure 6a shows that for 2005–2050, almost all the RCMs projecta general increase of daily precipitation. Specifically, the regions NWand CN (which include the Palermo area) are characterized by the low-est variation of growth curves across the RCMs ensemble; NW alsoexhibits the least variation with the return period. Again, this couldbe related to a combination of factors—the orography of this part ofthe island is less variable, the MAP is lower and less variable, and thenumber of rain gauges used for the correction. In both regions, allthe model projections suggest a raising of the growth curves.In the CS region (which includes part of Catania metropolitanarea), the RCM estimates project either a rising or a lowering of thegrowth curves in the immediate future. In the NC region, only threeRCM projections indicate a rise of the growth curve with the returnperiod, with a significant variation in the case of RCM7. Finally, asfor the current period, even the future projections of the RCMs indi-cate the steepest growth curves in the eastern part of Sicily, with theexception of RCM5 in region NE.These results thus demonstrate that the change (in time) of thegrowth curve in the future depends on the region, but also that, over-all, there is an increase in the steepness of the curve with return periodin the future as well as an increase of the uncertainty. For someregions, these aspects are even more emphasized for the 2050–2100time horizon (Figure 6b), particularly in regions NC, NW, CN, NE. Onlyprojections for region SE (which includes part of the Catania area) indi-cate a reduced steepness and variation of the growth curves with thereturn period in the later period.4.3 | Hourly extremesThis section analyses the results of the temporal downscaling, basedon the quantile–quantile mapping method, which first derives sub‐daily precipitation series from daily precipitation, and second,estimates the annual maximum precipitation at given durations, forboth the current period and future RCM projections. The TF parame-ters have been estimated by making use of the historical observationsFIGURE 6 Daily growth curves for each of the six regions and for the future project horizons (a) 2005–2050 and (b) 2050–2100 under the climatescenario RCP 8.5. The daily growth curve for the current period is shown for comparison (solid black line). The analysed metropolitan areas that fallwithin the regions are also indicated.

The correlation between observed extreme rainfall at differentsubsequent durations (1972–2003), that is, daily–24, 24–12, 12–6 hr,etc., was high, as demonstrated by values of the coefficients of deter-mination between the annual maximum value of precipitation (Table 3),confirming the hypothesis of a strong correlation between pairs of thesubsequent durations.For the sake of clarity, Figure 7 reports the empirical cumulativeprobability distribution of the observed and simulated series for 1, 3,6, 12, and 24 hr for one rain gauge and the corresponding grid cell inthe metropolitan area of Palermo (a) and Catania (b). For Palermo,the sub‐daily annual maxima rainfall are well reproduced by the RCMensemble, even if some extreme values are slightly underestimatedover most accumulation periods. The empirical cumulative probabilitydistributions for Catania are to the right with respect to those ofPalermo, denoting that, in this area, rainfall extremes are heavier, inaccordance with past studies (Cannarozzo et al., 1995, Lo Contiet al., 2007). Here, the uncertainty associated with the RCMs isgreater; most of the models underestimate the extreme values,although some models are able to capture the heaviest precipitationat a given duration. It is then evident that the proposed methodologyfor the temporal downscaling is able to capture the statistical relation-ship between the RCM data and the sub‐daily historical data. Asbefore, the estimated TF parameters were then applied to the futureRCM projections in order to assess how sub‐daily extremes are likelyto change in the future. Ideally, urban drainage system design requiresknowledge of rainfall depth intensity values over shorter durations(e.g., Carbone, Turco, Brunetti, & Piro, 2015, Pereira et al., 2015), withdaily or hourly data disaggregated to a shorter time step using thestatistical relationships between high temporal resolution and lowerresolution records (e.g., Pereira et al., 2015). However, the lack ofsub‐hourly rainfall observations here did not allow such downscalingto higher resolutions.Following the regional analysis described in Section 3.3 and inForestieri et al. (2017), we derived the growth curves for each homog-enous region, each duration, and for the two future projection hori-zons. For the sake of brevity, we report in Figure 8 the resultsobtained for 2050–2100 and for 1 (a) and 12 hr (b). In all regions, itis evident that the future projections lead to a raising and steepeningof the growth curves as the return period increases. The regions NC,NW, and CN are characterized by a wider range of uncertainty,although in all three cases, this is a result of the “outlier” curve pro-duced by RCM4. Growth curves at 12 hr duration (i.e., longer dura-tions; Figure 8b) are characterized by slightly gentler slopes thanthose of 1 hr duration (i.e., shorter duration); this means that thegrowth curves tend to be more amplified for shorter durations. Theensemble range is also narrower, and thus the uncertainty decreasesat this longer duration.4.4 | Changes in DDF curvesChanges in the DDF curves are analysed for the two selected raingauges within the metropolitan areas of Palermo and Catania(Figure 1a) for the two future horizons, 2005–2050 and 2050–2100.Figure 9 shows the DDF curves at 5, 10, 50, and 100 year returnperiods derived from the historical data (solid black line and greyshaded areas) and from the downscaled RCM outputs (box plots), forthe future horizon 2005–2050 and for Palermo (a) and Catania (b).TABLE 3 Mean coefficient of determination (R2 ) between the annualmaximum value of precipitation (1972–2003) at different durationsDuration R 2Day–24 hr 0.7624–12 hr 0.9312–6 hr 0.916–3 hr 0.903–1 hr 0.84FIGURE 7 Historical empirical cumulative probability distribution (1972–2003) of observed (black line) and simulated annual maxima rainfall at1,3,6,12, and 24 durations and for two stations of the metropolitan areas of (a) Palermo and (b) Catania. AMR = annual maximum rainfall;RCM = Regional Climate ModelFORESTIERI ET AL . 341For Palermo, the future scenario leads to a clear increase in intensitiesbased on the RCM ensemble medians, with a relatively small range ofuncertainty from the model ensemble. In terms of return period, theDDF curves of the future scenario approximately correspond to thecurrent curves, but at higher return periods; for example, the medianof the future DDF curve at 5 years corresponds to the current one at10 years. The same behaviour can be observed for other returnperiods. The same behaviour can be observed for other return periods.The variability depicted by the interquartile range of the boxplots,ranges from a few millimetre at 5 years to about 20 mm at 100 years,denoting that, for this case, the RCM outputs project similar results.However, in some cases, there is strong variability in terms of lowand high extremes (minimum and maximum whiskers), such as for thevery short durations (i.e., 1, 3, 6 hr) at 50 and 100 years.In the case of Catania (Figure 9b), the historical DDF curves areslightly higher than those for Palermo, confirming that this part ofthe island is usually characterized by heavier precipitation. The DDFcurves derived from the RCMs under the climate change scenarioshow a higher variability, which significantly increases with durationand even more with return period. For all four return periods, the var-iation of the future quantiles with respect to the historical quantilesdoes not increase linearly with the duration, with higher increases atlonger durations. In some cases, the quantiles obtained with someRCM models provided lower values than those obtained with thehistorical data, such as for 3, 6, and 12 hr at 10 years, 6, 12, and24 hr at 50 years, and 6 hr at 100 years. This could be due to the struc-tural uncertainty associated with the regional climatic models, as wellas the uncertainty derived from the temporal downscaling procedure.In terms of return period, the median of the DDF curves of the futurescenario for return periods greater than 10 years exhibit a more signif-icant increase compared to Palermo; for example, the future 50 yearDDF curve corresponds to the current 500 year DDF curve (notshown) for all durations.The same results are reported in Figure 10 for the future timehorizon 2050–2100. As expected, the median of the DDFs derivedfrom the model ensemble shows a greater increase from the historicalperiod, especially in the case of Catania for 50 and 100 year returnperiods, where the quantiles show greater variability as shown in thebox plots. However, it simultaneously increases the variability amongthe model ensemble. In particular, the higher increases of the 100 yearreturn period estimates for Catania (e.g., 12 and 24 hr) are also charac-terized by higher variability.The corresponding changes of the ensemble median DDF curvewith respect to the historical period are reported in Table 4, whichsummarizes the above results as representative of the two metropoli-tan areas considered here. The value of the percentage change pro-vides an immediate quantitative evaluation of the future changeprojected by the RCMs. For low return periods (i.e., 5 and 10 years),FIGURE 8 Growth curves for (a) 1 hr and (b) 12 hr for each of the six regions and for 2050–2100 under the climate scenario RCP 8.5. The growthcurve for the current period (black line) is shown for comparison. SE =south east; NC = north central; NE = north east; NW = north west;CN = centre north; CS = centre south; RCM = Regional Climate Model342 FORESTIERI ET AL .the changes in Palermo are larger than in Catania for short durations,for example, for T = 1 year and d = 1 hr changes are ~+37% (2005–2050) and ~+39% (2050–2100) for Palermo compared with ~+18%and ~+27%, respectively, for Catania. For high return periods and lon-ger durations, changes in Catania are significantly higher than those inPalermo, for example, for T = 100 year and d = 24 hr changes are ~+25% (2050–2100) for Palermo compared with ~+65% for Catania;for the short durations but high return periods, the changes are moreor less similar.The commonly used power‐law function of type H(d, T) = ad ^ n ,where a and n are site‐specific parameters, was fitted to the observedsub‐daily quantiles at given return period and to the median of the sub‐daily quantiles obtained from the RCM ensemble. The correspondingparameters are reported in Table 5, together with the changes of theparameters with respect to the historical DDFs. In the case of Palermo,parameter a, which is indicative of the quantile at the 1 hr duration, hasa maximum increase of 68% (2050–2100), which occurs at the longestreturn period (100 years). The parameter n, which is indicative of thescaling of the quantile with duration, decreases by up to 24% (2050–2100), denoting a reduced variation of the quantile with duration fora given return period. For Catania, the increase in a is up to 74%(2050–2100 at 100 years), which denotes a more considerable varia-tion of the quantile at the shortest durations; whereas n displays muchlower changes of varying sign compared to Palermo.The overall results indicate that for short durations, the increase inextremes is greater than that for longer durations, thus suggesting theidea that the intensification of extreme events is more evident for shortduration precipitation, usually associated with convective events. Thisis consistent with some previous research on the intensification ofextreme rainfall in relation to a warming atmosphere (Fowler & Kilsby,2003). The Clausius–Clapeyron relation (CC) suggests that if relativehumidity remains constant, atmospheric humidity will increase at a ratethat follows the saturation vapour pressure dependency on temperatureaccording to the CC relation—a rate of ~7% per °C of surface warming(e.g., Allen & Ingram, 2002). Several studies have provided observationalevidence of a ~2× CC relationship for hourly extremes (e.g., Lenderink &van Meijgaard, 2008, 2010; Mishra, Wallace, & Lettenmaier, 2012),which might suggest an amplified response to warming on thesetimescales and is consistent with the projections obtained here.5 | SUMM ARY AND DISCUSSIO NThis study has provided an insight into the potential impacts of climatechange on extreme precipitation for the Mediterranean island of Sicily(Italy), starting from an ensemble of RCM simulations at the daily time-scale. Changes in extremes clearly affect the shape of DDF curves,which are commonly used for the design of hydraulic infrastructure,FIGURE 9 Depth‐Duration‐Frequency curves at 5, 10, 50, and 100 year return periods (from first to fourth column, respectively) derived from thehistorical data (solid black line) and from the downscaled Regional Climate Model (RCM) outputs (box plot) for the future horizon 2005–2050 andfor Palermo (a) and Catania (b). In each panel, the dashed lines depict the median of the RCMs ensemble, whereas the gradual‐grey shaded areasdelimit the intervals of return periods (i.e., T5, T10, T50, T100, T500) corresponding to current Depth‐Duration‐Frequency curves. Finally, thepercentage numbers indicate the relative increases compared to RCM ensemble for the different durationsFORESTIERI ET AL . 343and thus normally adopted for urban planning policies. For this reason,understanding possible changes in heavy, short duration precipitationis necessary for the updating of DDF curves.The spatial resolution of the available RCM outputs for theMediterranean area does not currently provide precipitation productsat a sub‐daily scale from CPMs, therefore, a temporal downscalingFIGURE 10 As for Figure 9, but for the future horizon 2050–2100TABLE 4 Historical and future values of the quantiles of the median DDF curves and percentage changes with respect to the historical period, forPalermo and CataniaReturnperiod(T) [year]Palermo CataniaDuration(d) [h]Historical[mm]RCM median[mm]Change[%]Historical[mm]RCM median[mm]Change[%]1972–2003 2005–2050 2050–2100 2005–2050 2050–2100 1972–2003 2005–2050 2050–2100 2005–2050 2050–21005 1 25.96 35.75 36.30 37.69 39.81 44.56 52.61 56.75 18.06 27.363 36.44 48.02 48.74 31.77 33.76 65.68 78.05 86.47 18.83 31.666 46.97 61.76 62.68 31.48 33.44 80.43 94.60 103.63 17.61 28.8412 58.51 73.54 74.41 25.69 27.17 107.19 125.76 135.35 17.32 26.2724 72.24 95.95 101.13 32.81 39.98 133.46 161.94 177.68 21.34 33.1410 1 31.35 45.08 46.09 43.78 47.00 53.91 66.96 71.91 24.20 33.393 43.81 60.54 61.60 38.19 40.60 78.48 102.04 111.61 30.02 42.216 56.88 76.88 77.54 35.15 36.31 96.97 121.97 132.99 25.78 37.1412 72.41 90.34 91.37 24.75 26.18 127.71 161.80 172.84 26.69 35.3424 91.32 117.06 121.78 28.19 33.36 157.97 205.67 224.53 30.19 42.1350 1 43.52 67.70 68.74 55.57 57.96 74.91 104.72 119.98 39.79 60.163 60.76 90.29 94.83 48.60 56.06 106.94 165.70 186.18 54.95 74.106 80.25 113.94 117.18 41.98 46.02 134.57 195.09 208.24 44.98 54.7512 106.59 131.89 134.63 23.73 26.30 172.52 243.32 267.63 41.04 55.1324 140.11 168.64 178.89 20.36 27.68 210.88 306.36 326.75 45.27 54.94100 1 48.82 78.55 78.89 60.88 61.58 84.03 123.34 141.30 46.78 68.163 68.27 104.98 109.74 53.78 60.76 119.19 198.14 221.24 66.24 85.626 90.80 131.17 136.34 44.45 50.15 151.05 228.99 244.56 51.60 61.9112 122.54 151.33 154.79 23.49 26.32 191.53 277.98 312.89 45.13 63.3624 163.62 196.50 205.60 20.09 25.65 233.11 349.60 384.83 49.97 65.08Note.

In this study, the products of the EURO‐CORDEX with ~12 kmspatial resolution were used to accomplish different targets. Specifi-cally, the main results and outcomes can be summarized as follows:1. We demonstrated the capability of the available EURO‐CORDEXRCM runs to reproduce extreme precipitation at the daily scaleover Sicily. However, because precipitation in Sicily is stronglyinfluenced by the highly variable orography (Di Piazza et al.,2011; Forestieri et al., 2017), a bias correction method was neces-sary to reduce the errors between observed and simulated precip-itation as demonstrated by other studies in other Mediterraneanareas (e.g., Dosio & Paruolo, 2011; Dosio, 2016; C. Piani, Haerter,et al., 2010 and C. Piani, Weedon, et al., 2010). In particular, thenon‐parametric statistical transformation, based on the quantilemethod approach, provided successful results, allowing for a sig-nificant reduction of the bias between observed and simulatedstatistics, reducing the uncertainty range of the RCM ensembledespite both methods having theoretical limitations (White &Toumi, 2013). The efficiency of the bias correction method waslinked to the use of statistically homogenous regions developedby Forestieri et al. (2017), which were used for the RFA. Thegrowth curves at a given durations (i.e., 1 day) were derived fromobserved and simulated annual maxima for the “control period”and the results demonstrate that RCM output could be reliablyused to estimate extremes at the daily scale in Sicily after biascorrection.2. We analysed the impacts of climate change on the regionalgrowth curves over two future projection time horizons,2005–2050 and 2050–2100, and under the RCPs 8.5 scenarioby means of the corresponding RCM outputs. The overall resultsshowed a steepening of the growth curves for the future climate,especially for 2050–2100, thus indicating an increase theintensity of extreme precipitation events. However, the resultsfor some regions also indicated significant variability, and thusuncertainty resulting from the RCM ensemble, which increasesfor the farthest future time horizon. Clearly, this is due to othersources of uncertainty such as those resulting from errors in theprojections of the climate models themselves (C. Piani, Weedon,et al., 2010).3. To estimate the changes in sub‐daily precipitation, we applied atemporal downscaling method based on the quantile–quantilematching approach, also used to correct the RCMs products.The matching between observed and modelled data was shownfor two rain gauges, located in Palermo and Catania, in terms ofAMR at different durations, demonstrating that the modelledseries reproduced well the AMR, especially in the case of Palermo,although very extreme values were underestimated. An analysisof growth curves showed that the increase of the growth coeffi-cient with return period is more evident for the shortest durations(1 hr). The lack of sub‐hourly rainfall has restricted the analysis tothe hourly time scale, although in urban drainage systems, sub‐hourly rainfall is fundamental in the design stage.4. For Palermo and Catania, we evaluated the impact of changes inextreme precipitation on the DDF curves. The results showed anincrease in the quantiles at different durations, especially in caseof the Catania urban area, which is characterized by higherannual maxima rainfall than Palermo and slightly higher MAP.However, even in this case, the variability of the RCM projectionswas more substantial for the higher return periods and thelongest future time horizon. Similar studies of DDFs (or inten-sity‐duration‐frequencies), for example, Mirhosseini, Srivastava,and Stefanova (2013), obtained comparable outcomes; however,they did not assess the uncertainty associated with the RCMs.Changes of the DDF curve parameters also indicated a significantincrease of the quantile at the shortest duration (parameter a);and a tendency for a reduced variation of the quantile with dura-tion at a given return period (parameter n).5. The changes in the DDF curves may have important implicationsfor the management of the existing urban hydraulic systems ofthe two analysed areas as well as for the severity and thefrequency of urban floods in the two cities. The shift of theDDF curves towards heavier extreme events may determine theinfrastructure deficit of micro and macro drainage facilities thatwill consequently be undersized to meet future demands, as dem-onstrated also in other studies (e.g., Tucci & Collischonn, 2000;Rodrìguez et al., 2014). During heavy precipitation events, thewater that flows in the pipe system returns to the street systemif the capacity of the drainage system is insufficient, thus causingsurface flooding. These dynamics are normally simulated throughTABLE 5 Historical and future changes of the parameters a and n of the DDF curve equations with respect to the historical period, for the stationslocated in Palermo and CataniaReturnperiod(T) [year]Palermo CataniaHistorical RCM median Change [%] Historical RCM median Change [%]1972–2003 2005–2050 2050–2100 2005–2050 2050–2100 1972–2003 2005–2050 2050–2100 2005–2050 2050–21005 a 25.89 35.11 35.36 35.62 36.59 44.47 52.29 56.92 17.58 28.00n 0.325 0.309 0.317 −5.10 −2.46 0.346 0.352 0.353 1.47 1.8510 a 30.91 44.50 45.15 43.99 46.08 53.77 67.40 72.82 25.30 35.40n 0.340 0.297 0.300 −12.59 −11.65 0.340 0.350 0.352 2.79 3.2650 a 42.05 67.14 68.54 59.66 62.98 74.86 108.53 123.88 44.98 65.49n 0.372 0.284 0.292 −23.63 −21.48 0.329 0.330 0.308 0.15 −6.38100 a 46.85 77.79 79.07 66.05 68.77 84.06 129.41 146.41 53.96 74.18n 0.385 0.283 0.292 −26.37 −24.14 0.325 0.317 0.306 −2.59 −5.76Note.

Specifically, the DDF shift may modify the spatialdistribution of the critical network nodes, that is, the nodes wherewater comes out from manholes, and a significant question maybe how these changes will have an impact in terms of the numberof failing drainage network nodes. What we can expect is then adecrease of the return period of the current drainage systems ifno management changes are designed (as an order of magnitude,Willems, 2013 obtained a maximum variation from 20 to 5 yearsin a case study in Belgium). Finally, in the case of urban storagefacilities, we may expect that extra storage capacity could berequired (e.g., 10–40%; Willems, 2013). As a consequence ofthese possible future implications, two different strategies couldbe then adopted by the urban planners and designers, that is, aprogramme of routine and scheduled replacement and renewalof ageing infrastructure, and/or the adoption of optimizationmethods for climate change adaptation (e.g., green infrastructure,SUDS; Zhou, Panduro, Thorsen, & Arnbjerg‐Nielsen, 2013). Theoverall results clearly provide an important indication of futureprecipitation extremes and the impact of climate change onextreme events. These results are in accordance with other stud-ies that analysed the potential implication of global warming ondifferent Mediterranean areas, such as Deidda et al. (2013), Piraset al. (2014), and Panthou et al. (2016), who indicated that, ondaily and sub‐daily time scales, heavy events are projected tobecome more frequent and more intense.No assessment of projected changes in short‐duration rainfallextremes for Sicily has previously been published to our knowledge.However, it is clear that our findings (as well as those of other studies)are affected by uncertainty associated with climate model errors andthe use of convection parameterisation schemes, in addition to thetemporal downscaling that is based on the assumption of stationarityof the TFs. The application of statistical tools for bias correction anddisaggregation procedures however remains indispensable for repro-ducing sub‐daily series, whereas ensembles of CPM simulations arenot available. Such sub‐daily series are an important requirement whenclimate forcing for hydrological models has to be generated. In the spe-cific case of Sicily, the climate and hydrological regime is also stronglyrelated to the highly variable topographic characteristics, which mayincrease the sources of uncertainty. Because a full Europe CPM runis underway with results expected in 2018, a future extension of thiswork will involve the comparison of our findings with those obtainedfrom higher resolution climate models.6 | CONCLUSIONSThis study has provided an overview of possible changes in extremeprecipitation over Sicily, and in DDF curves for the two main metropol-itan areas, induced by climate change, by using the outputs of anensemble of RCMs. The consequent changes in the DDF curvesshowed that we may expect an intensification of extreme events,especially in the wetter east area of the island. As a possibleconsequence, an increase of severity and frequency of urban floodsmay be expected in the future, as well as a more frequent failure ofthe sewer system capacity if no appropriate management actions aretaken. The procedure applied in this study provides a possible method-ology that can be used to evaluate the potential changes in the DDFcurves. Further applications in other locations represent a possiblestep of our research focusing on the urban drainage and flooding.Design and optimisation of urban drainage infrastructure thatconsiders climate change impacts is a further, new perspective forthe future.ACKNOWLEDGMENTSStephen Blenkinsop and Hayley J.
